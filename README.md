# AngularAdminPannel

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

In Angular, I have developed an Admin Panel Template that provides a set of reusable components for creating administrative dashboards and interfaces. The template is built using Angular, a popular front-end JavaScript framework, which provides a robust and flexible development environment. The use of Angular components allows for easy integration and customization, providing a high level of flexibility for developers to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface. One of the key benefits of using the Admin Panel Template is its component reusability. Each component has been designed to be modular and can be reused in different parts of the dashboard or application. This saves time and effort and allows for the creation of a consistent user interface.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
